When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    -want to share code with others
    -want to work on multiple computers and don't have remote access to the local work
    -want to be able to view the code online using a browser
    -want others to be able to the view the code online using a browser
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    -might pull over a file you're working on

 
Forking a repository

fork = a clone that github makes on its own machines

side effects = 
    github keeps track of the number of people who have made forks on your repository
    the forks all link back to the original
    makes it easier to suggest changes back to the original repository

Caroline forks a copy to her account, called recipes
Each can clone a version from the forked version

git clone https://github.com/nrhawkins/recipes.git

git remote -v (see that the remote origin has been automatically created)

Settings -> Collaborators -> add Sarah as a collaborator


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    forks - get a copy of a repo on github to make changes, when you don't have permission to change the orig repo
    clones - get a repo from github
    branches - create on local repository to work on a new feature
